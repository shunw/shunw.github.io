- Cadence: a sequence of two or more chords that lead the lessoner back to the Harmonic center or tonic of a piece of music. 

    - ex ii-V-I of C Major leads back to the C Major/ Tonic 

    - ii-V-I is Perfect Candence (strongest candence because it contains G7 resolves to the C Major)

    - Perfect Candence usually used in End of Songs/ End of Sections 

- example on G Major 

    - I chord is tonice/ harmonic center.
