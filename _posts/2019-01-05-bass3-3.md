- Cadence: a sequence of two or more chords that lead the lessoner back to the Harmonic center or tonic of a piece of music. 

    - ex ii-V-I of C Major leads back to the C Major/ Tonic 

    - ii-V-I is Perfect Candence (strongest candence because it contains G7 resolves to the C Major)

    - Perfect Candence usually used in End of Songs/ End of Sections 

- example on G Major 

    - I chord is tonice/ harmonic center. 

    - find the I - G, ii - A (Minor 7th), V - D (D7)

    - A Minor 7 -> D7 -> G Major 7

- Transpose 

    - defination: just by moving a major scale shape around the finger board, you actually transposing the sequence of notes into different key. 

    - example: easy to transpose the A Major -> C# Major/ A -> C# is Major

    - G Major: ii (A Minor 7) V (D7) I (G Major 7) -> Upper Minor 3rd
        
        - find the root note: A D G

        - upper minor 3rd for the root notes: A -> C/ D -> F/ G -> Bb

        - ii (C Minor 7) V (F7) I (Bb Major 7)

- Practice
