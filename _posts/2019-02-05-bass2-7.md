### __Lesson 7 - What are Modes and why you should play them__

- **PURPOSE**: to briefly introduce the concept of modes

- What exactly are 'modes'?
    
    - the concept behind modes, originated in ANCIENT GREECE. From these beginnings in Greece, the concept of modes was eventually adopted by the Catholic church in Rome

    - Modes are basically scales, and importantly they possess their own unique indivuidual character and mode

    - learn major scale first is that it serves as pefect gateway to enter into the world Modes. 

    - the reason why they're called modes in the first place is that they are **not different scales**, but instad, different sequences of notes, all modes taken from scales we already know. 

- the modes of the major scale: Ionian / Major Scale used the notes contain in it. We can create other scale or modes from it, and the different modes that we create using this process are refer to the music as **the modes of the major scale**. 

    - Take example from C major scale, the following modes are only using the notes form the C major scales.
