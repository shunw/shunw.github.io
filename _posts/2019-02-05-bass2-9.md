**AIM**: to get you associating and using the Dorian Mode with a chord by looking at the intervals contains within these mode, and introducing another triad arpeggio and chord

- D Dorian consist of D(1st) E F(3rd) G A(5th) B C(7th)

- Interval between D and F is called minor 3rd

    - shape 1 (D -> F)

    - shape 2 (D -> F)

    ![min3-2](/../assets/img/bass/inter-9-min3-2.png)

- Interval between D and A is called interval of a fifth

    - shape

- minor TRIAD: first 3 chord tones

    - D F A create minor triad. 
    
    - the root note is D, so this is called D minor Triad

    - Play these three notes together would create D minor chord

    - Difference between minor triad to a major triad is minor triad contains a minor third, while major triad contains a major third

- minor 7th

    - adding the 4th note would construct D minor 7th chord which also noted as Dm7, D-7, Dminor7th, Dmin7

    - D F A C => minor 7th; the root note is D, so this is called D minor 7th

    - All chord tones of a Dorian mode spell out a minor 7th chord

- arpeggio (D) minor:

    - shape 1 (D min arpeggio, details: 7:17; practice: 7:50)

    ![min-2](/../assets/img/bass/inter-9-min-arp-2.png)

- arpeggio (D) minor 7th:

    - shape 1 (details: 9:55; practice: 10:18)
