- **Basic**: 

    - Build Dorian Mode only use the notes from C major scale

    - D Dorian is the 2nd mode of the C major scale; E Dorian is the 2nd mode of D major scale. 

    - start from the 2nd note which is D from major scale.

- **Main Content**: Familiar with D Dorian shapes and say the note name out loud.

    - go with what feels nature to you most, as an individual. 

    - Don't limit yourself to one position. To explore the other ways you can spell out the sound of D Dorian in the position across the neck. By finding the notes from C major, you can easily create D Dorian elsewhere on the neck. 

    - It's important to get used to play modes and scales through and beyond the typical one octave range

- **shapes and skip 3rd**:

    - shape 1: (detailed explanation: 2:19; practice example: 3:38)
