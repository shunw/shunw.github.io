- **PURPOSE**: introduce other major scales; what is ACCIDENTALS. 

- **TAKEAWAY**: 

    - bass guitar is the instruments tuned symmetrically

        - the interval or distance between the pitches of our open strings is always the same. 

        - How can we make use of it? 

            - record the shape of C major scale and start from other root notes. 

    - there are 12 semi-tones intervals contains within one octave. 

        - A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, C, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab

        - We can take any of these 12 notes and use them as root note to begin a major scale from

        - strive to achieve the same level of the confidence with any of the other major scales in terms of knowing the notes that used to construct them
    
    - When you pick a major scale please make sure to choose the root note from the E string/ A string that way you have the space availbe to complete the scale up and down

    - It's the order of notes, and more importantly, the intervals between notes of individual notes that dictates the sound or character of any scale. 

    - unnatural notes #/b are known as ACCIDENTALS

- **PRACTICE**: 

    - list 12 semi-tones contained in an octave.

    - use those notes as root notes to begin ohter major scales from.

    - say the note names out aloud when you play the major scale. 

    - use both major scale shapes during the exercises.
