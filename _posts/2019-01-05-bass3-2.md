- to understand ii-V-I

- C Ionian (C Major 7th) + D Dorian (D Minor 7th) + G Mixolydian (G7 [G, B, D, F]) => ii-V-I (2-5-1)

- Dominant 7 (G7) is a little unstable.
    
    - is the interval between Major 3rd (B) and Flattened 7th (F)
    
    - this interval is called the i Tri-tone. 

    - B and F is flatten 5. 
    
    - G7 resolves to C Major. 

- Practice: create your own bass line of ii-V-I of C major.
