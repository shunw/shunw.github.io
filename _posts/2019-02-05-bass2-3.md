### __Lesson 3 - How scales are linked to chords__

- **Purpose**: 

    - look at how the scale links to chords 
    
    - how to use this relationship to contruct musical ideas

- start within C major scale chord tones

- CHORD TONES: 1st 3rd 5th 7th notes, which is C E G B 

- TRIAD:
    
    - Any three chord tones of any scale and create somthing called triad

    - different type of triad depending on the scales we use. 

    - C Major Triad: C E G, due to it contained within C major scale
    
    - if we play the C major Triad **together** at the same time we create C major CHORD

- INTERVALS: 
    
    - as bass players, we want to be able to spell out the sound of any chord just by using individual notes, and to really get this concept under our belts, we need to learn about intervals. 

    - the term INTERVALS is used to describe the distance between two notes in music

    - Interval Major 3rd: 
        
        - ex: C -> E

        - interval between these two notes in music is what's called a major 3rd

        - the shape is always the interval of a major 3rd no matter where we choose to play it

        - but as you are hopefully aware it's the notes the change as we move the shape around

        - ex: C -> E + G -> B both notes are used to form a major triad

        - learn how to play intervals in different ways 

        - Below two shapes are differnt, but they use EXACTLY the same notes. 

        - shape 1 & shape 2

    - Interval perfect 5th: C -> G

        - shape 1 & shape 2 (lower than the root notes, use in the Country ex 6:16; Reggae feel ex 6:27) :

    - Interval of Octave: 
        
        - shape: 

        ![octave](/../assets/img/bass/inter-3-octave.png)    

        - ex: 7:21

        - ex: 7:36

    - Interval of Major 3rd an octave lower, ex: 8:00: 
        
        - shape: 

        ![major3lower](/../assets/img/bass/inter-3-major3lower.png)    

    - Interval of Major 3rd free style, ex: 8:35: 

        - even though major triad is just three notes, by varying where you to play these notes either up or down the octave, can open up a lot of musical possibilities and in turn give us more ideas theat outling the sound of major chord

- **PRACTICE**

    - C major Practive Groove 9:46
