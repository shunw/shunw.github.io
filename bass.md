### __Lesson 2 - Play in Key__

- **PURPOSE**: introduce a concept that will simplify the way you think of in major scale notes and lay the building blocks for you to move on and better understand the musical notion in the future. 

- certain rules to obey when naming notes, #/b -> key signature
    
    - 3rd note of E major scale could be Ab or G#
    
    - E key signature is 
    
    ![keyE](/../assets/img/bass/keyE.png)
    
    - the key signature dictates 3rd is # or b

- rule 1: each individual major scale is, in it self a key signature. / root note of any jamor scale is __its key__
    
    - ex: C major scale is key of C major

    - ex: E major scale is in the key of E major

- rule 2: if you start a major scale on a flat note, refer to accidentals in that scale as flat notes. (also could apply on the F major scale)

    - ex: Eb major scale: Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D - Eb

    - ex: Ab major scale: Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G - Ab

- rule 3: if you start a major scale on a sharp note, refer to accidentals in that scale as sharp notes. (also could apply on the B / E / A / D / G major)
    
    - remember as **B**OOTSY **G**ROOVES **A**ND **E**VERYONE **D**ANCES

    - ex: F# major scale: F# - G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E# - F#

- **PRACTICE**: familiar with all the 12 major scale with theirs notes

### __Lesson 4 - What are Arpeggios and why you should play them__

- play the chord tones

- word mean: Broken chord. the Italian meaning is Harp-like, due to the nature of the instrument, the notes on a Harp sustain. / Fundamentally, every note is played individually. 

- difference between chord and arpeggios
    
    - chord: played at the same time. 

    - arpeggios: play chord tones individually in sequence either up or down. 

- C Triad/ C Major arpeggios

    - C Major Triad: C -> E -> G

    - C Major Arpeggios: C -> E -> G -> C

- examples with C major arpeggios: 

    - ex1 (2:57): up

    ![ex1](/../assets/img/bass/inter-4-ex1.png)

    - ex2 (3:24): down

    ![ex2](/../assets/img/bass/inter-4-ex2.png)

    - ex3 (4:13): up and down

    ![ex3](/../assets/img/bass/inter-4-ex3.png)

    - ex4 (6:02 & 7:21): other finger shape for the major arpeggios

    ![ex4](/../assets/img/bass/inter-4-ex4.png)


### __Lesson 5 - Extending the Major Triad [tbc]__

- chord tones consist of: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th

- difference between Major Triad & Major 7th chord

    - Major Triad: 1st, 3rd, 5th/ C Major Triad: C E G

    - Major 7th: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th/ C Major 7th: C E G B

        - write as: C major 7th; C maj 7; CM 7; C :small_red_triangle: 7

### __Lesson 6 - Exercises to use in your daily practice rountine [tbc]__

- Two shapes to play major scales 

    - purpose: link 2 major scales shapes through up octave & on up to a high fifth

    - example is A Major/ detailed explanation 1:55 & 2:36

    - go through practice (3:54)

- Skipping in thirds 
    - example is C Major/ detailed explanation 4:50

    - go through practice (7:20)

- Practice @ 100 bpm (9:30), consist of below back and forth: 
    
    - C Major type I 

    - C Major type II

    - C Major type I skipping third

    - C Major chord + C Major 7th chord + C Major & C Major 7th chord

    - C Major two shapes on the 8th E chord

    - C Major two shapes on the 8th E chord + skipping third

### __Lesson 10 - Creating Bass Lines Using the Dorian Mode[tbc]__

- Dorian Mode + Miner / Miner 7 chords

- C major => D Dorian Mode

- VAMP is A repeatable secion of music that can contain a chords sequence

- Example 1/ 2:25 (D Dorian exclusively - __Blues Rock__ VAMP on D minor 7th chord. )

![ex1](/../assets/img/bass/inter-10-ex1.png)

- Example 2/ 6:23 (C Dorian - __Reggae__ Bass Line - C Minor 7th VAMP)
