### __Lesson 1 - The 12 major scales explained__

- **PURPOSE**: introduce other major scales; what is ACCIDENTALS. 

- **TAKEAWAY**: 

    - bass guitar is the instruments tuned symmetrically

        - the interval or distance between the pitches of our open strings is always the same. 

        - How can we make use of it? 

            - record the shape of C major scale and start from other root notes. 

    - there are 12 semi-tones intervals contains within one octave. 

        - A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, C, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab

        - We can take any of these 12 notes and use them as root note to begin a major scale from

        - strive to achieve the same level of the confidence with any of the other major scales in terms of knowing the notes that used to construct them
    
    - When you pick a major scale please make sure to choose the root note from the E string/ A string that way you have the space availbe to complete the scale up and down

    - It's the order of notes, and more importantly, the intervals between notes of individual notes that dictates the sound or character of any scale. 

    - unnatural notes #/b are known as ACCIDENTALS

- **PRACTICE**: 

    - list 12 semi-tones contained in an octave.

    - use those notes as root notes to begin ohter major scales from.

    - say the note names out aloud when you play the major scale. 

    - use both major scale shapes during the exercises. 

### __Lesson 2 - Play in Key__

- **PURPOSE**: introduce a concept that will simplify the way you think of in major scale notes and lay the building blocks for you to move on and better understand the musical notion in the future. 

- certain rules to obey when naming notes, #/b -> key signature
    
    - 3rd note of E major scale could be Ab or G#
    
    - E key signature is 
    
    ![keyE](/../assets/img/bass/keyE.png)
    
    - the key signature dictates 3rd is # or b

- rule 1: each individual major scale is, in it self a key signature. / root note of any jamor scale is __its key__
    
    - ex: C major scale is key of C major

    - ex: E major scale is in the key of E major

- rule 2: if you start a major scale on a flat note, refer to accidentals in that scale as flat notes. (also could apply on the F major scale)

    - ex: Eb major scale: Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D - Eb

    - ex: Ab major scale: Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G - Ab

- rule 3: if you start a major scale on a sharp note, refer to accidentals in that scale as sharp notes. (also could apply on the B / E / A / D / G major)
    
    - remember as **B**OOTSY **G**ROOVES **A**ND **E**VERYONE **D**ANCES

    - ex: F# major scale: F# - G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E# - F#

- **PRACTICE**: familiar with all the 12 major scale with theirs notes

### __Lesson 3 - How scales are linked to chords__

- **Purpose**: 

    - look at how the scale links to chords 
    
    - how to use this relationship to contruct musical ideas

- start within C major scale chord tones

- CHORD TONES: 1st 3rd 5th 7th notes, which is C E G B 

- TRIAD:
    
    - Any three chord tones of any scale and create somthing called triad

    - different type of triad depending on the scales we use. 

    - C Major Triad: C E G, due to it contained within C major scale
    
    - if we play the C major Triad **together** at the same time we create C major CHORD

- INTERVALS: 
    
    - as bass players, we want to be able to spell out the sound of any chord just by using individual notes, and to really get this concept under our belts, we need to learn about intervals. 

    - the term INTERVALS is used to describe the distance between two notes in music

    - Interval Major 3rd: 
        
        - ex: C -> E

        - interval between these two notes in music is what's called a major 3rd

        - the shape is always the interval of a major 3rd no matter where we choose to play it

        - but as you are hopefully aware it's the notes the change as we move the shape around

        - ex: C -> E + G -> B both notes are used to form a major triad

        - learn how to play intervals in different ways 

        - Below two shapes are differnt, but they use EXACTLY the same notes. 

        - shape 1 & shape 2

        ![major3](/../assets/img/bass/inter-3-major3.png)    

    - Interval perfect 5th: C -> G

        - shape 1 & shape 2 (lower than the root notes, use in the Country ex 6:16; Reggae feel ex 6:27) :

        ![perfect5](/../assets/img/bass/inter-3-perfect5.png)    
    
    - Interval of Octave: 
        
        - shape: 

        ![octave](/../assets/img/bass/inter-3-octave.png)    

        - ex: 7:21

        - ex: 7:36

    - Interval of Major 3rd an octave lower, ex: 8:00: 
        
        - shape: 

        ![major3lower](/../assets/img/bass/inter-3-major3lower.png)    

    - Interval of Major 3rd free style, ex: 8:35: 

        - even though major triad is just three notes, by varying where you to play these notes either up or down the octave, can open up a lot of musical possibilities and in turn give us more ideas theat outling the sound of major chord

        ![freestyle](/../assets/img/bass/inter-3-freestyle.png)    

- **PRACTICE**

    - C major Practive Groove 9:46

### __Lesson 4 - What are Arpeggios and why you should play them__

- play the chord tones

- word mean: Broken chord. the Italian meaning is Harp-like, due to the nature of the instrument, the notes on a Harp sustain. / Fundamentally, every note is played individually. 

- difference between chord and arpeggios
    
    - chord: played at the same time. 

    - arpeggios: play chord tones individually in sequence either up or down. 

- C Triad/ C Major arpeggios

    - C Major Triad: C -> E -> G

    - C Major Arpeggios: C -> E -> G -> C

- examples with C major arpeggios: 

    - ex1 (2:57): up

    ![ex1](/../assets/img/bass/inter-4-ex1.png)

    - ex2 (3:24): down

    ![ex2](/../assets/img/bass/inter-4-ex2.png)

    - ex3 (4:13): up and down

    ![ex3](/../assets/img/bass/inter-4-ex3.png)

    - ex4 (6:02 & 7:21): other finger shape for the major arpeggios

    ![ex4](/../assets/img/bass/inter-4-ex4.png)


### __Lesson 5 - Extending the Major Triad [tbc]__

- chord tones consist of: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th

- difference between Major Triad & Major 7th chord

    - Major Triad: 1st, 3rd, 5th/ C Major Triad: C E G

    - Major 7th: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th/ C Major 7th: C E G B

        - write as: C major 7th; C maj 7; CM 7; C :small_red_triangle: 7

### __Lesson 6 - Exercises to use in your daily practice rountine [tbc]__

- Two shapes to play major scales 

    - purpose: link 2 major scales shapes through up octave & on up to a high fifth

    - example is A Major/ detailed explanation 1:55 & 2:36

    - go through practice (3:54)

- Skipping in thirds 
    - example is C Major/ detailed explanation 4:50

    - go through practice (7:20)

- Practice @ 100 bpm (9:30), consist of below back and forth: 
    
    - C Major type I 

    - C Major type II

    - C Major type I skipping third

    - C Major chord + C Major 7th chord + C Major & C Major 7th chord

    - C Major two shapes on the 8th E chord

    - C Major two shapes on the 8th E chord + skipping third

### __Lesson 7 - What are Modes and why you should play them__

- **PURPOSE**: to briefly introduce the concept of modes

- What exactly are 'modes'?
    
    - the concept behind modes, originated in ANCIENT GREECE. From these beginnings in Greece, the concept of modes was eventually adopted by the Catholic church in Rome

    - Modes are basically scales, and importantly they possess their own unique indivuidual character and mode

    - learn major scale first is that it serves as pefect gateway to enter into the world Modes. 

    - the reason why they're called modes in the first place is that they are **not different scales**, but instad, different sequences of notes, all modes taken from scales we already know. 

- the modes of the major scale: Ionian / Major Scale used the notes contain in it. We can create other scale or modes from it, and the different modes that we create using this process are refer to the music as **the modes of the major scale**. 

    - Take example from C major scale, the following modes are only using the notes form the C major scales. 

| start from ?th note | mode | charactor |
| --- | --- | ---|
| 1 | C Ionian | contain 7 different toens; 3rd & 4th, 7th & 8th are semi tones |
| 2 | D Dorian | tbd | 
| 3 | E Phrygian| tbd |
| 4 | F Lydian | tbd |
| 5 | G Mixolydian | tbd |
| 6 | A Aeolian | tbd |
| 7 | B Locrian | tbd |

### __Lesson 8 - What is the Dorian Mode?__

- Based on the C Major Scale

- Dorian Mode only use the notes from C major scale

- Dorian is known as the 2nd mode of the major scale. All we have to construct is start from the 2nd note which is D. 

    - ex: 2nd mode of D major scale is E Dorian

- **Main Content**: Familiar with D Dorian shapes and say the note name out loud.

    - go with what feels nature ot you most as an indidual. 

    - Don't limit yourself to one position. To explore the other ways you can spell out the sound of D Dorian in the position across the neck by finding the notes from C major, you can easily create D Dorian else where on the nack. 

    - It's important to get used to play modes and scales through and beyond the typical one octave range

    - apply skip 3rd in D Dorian. (guide you through how to skip in D Dorian 6:32; practice 7:42)

    - shape 1: (detailed explanation: 2:19; practice example: 3:38)

    - shape 2: (detailed explanation: 4:39; practice example: 4:55)



### __Lesson 9 - The Dorian Mode Continued__



### __Lesson 10 - Creating Bass Lines Using the Dorian Mode[tbc]__

- Dorian Mode + Miner / Miner 7 chords

- C major => D Dorian Mode

- VAMP is A repeatable secion of music that can contain a chords sequence

- Example 1/ 2:25 (D Dorian exclusively - __Blues Rock__ VAMP on D minor 7th chord. )

![ex1](/../assets/img/bass/inter-10-ex1.png)

- Example 2/ 6:23 (C Dorian - __Reggae__ Bass Line - C Minor 7th VAMP) 


- Example 3/ 9:14 (D Dorian - __Jazz feel__ Walking Bass Line - D Minor 7th VAMP)
